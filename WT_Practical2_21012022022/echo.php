<!-- 
    
This is a type of output string.

Displaying Strings as multiple arguments: We can pass multiple string 
arguments to the echo statement instead of a single string argument, separating them by comma (‘,’) operator. 
For example, if we have two strings i.e “Hello” and “World” then we can pass them as (“Hello”, “World”).

It can't return any value.
Syntax
echo $arg1 , $arg2 ...;

<?php
    echo "Multiple ","argument ","string!";
?>
